\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\section{Conclusion}
This project was a big challenge, but it made me even more excited about these subjects. It showed me how much potential they have for my future work.
The experience made me want to learn more in this area. I'm now eager to build better models, look at different assets and markets as well as adding new features mentioned in next section for "Future Work". I'm more motivated than ever to push my limits and see what more I can do.

\section{Further Work}
In the continued development of the backtesting framework, several enhancements and updates are planned:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementation of regression-based and deep learning-based backtesting strategies.
    \item Development of an assembler that leverages multiple strategies from diverse machine learning and deep learning paradigms such as regression and classification.
    \item Consideration for automated portfolio management functionalities.
    \item Exploring the incorporation of Natural Language Understanding for sentiment analysis. Potential data sources for this sentiment analysis include platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and other trading-relevant sources.
\end{itemize}

Moving in these directions can make the backtesting more flexible and accurate.
