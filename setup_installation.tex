To set up the environment for backtesting and deploying trading strategies, follow the steps below:

\subsection{Prerequisites:}

Ensure that you have \href{https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution}{Anaconda} or \href{https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html}{Miniconda} installed on your machine. If not, download and install the appropriate version for your operating system.

\subsection{Steps:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Navigate to the project directory:}
    Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory where the \texttt{requirements.yaml} file is located. This file contains all the necessary package dependencies and configurations for the backtesting environment.

    \item \textbf{Create the Conda environment:}
    Run the following command to create the \texttt{trading} environment using the configurations specified in the \texttt{requirements.yaml} file:

\begin{verbatim}
conda env create -f requirements.yaml
\end{verbatim}
    This command will set up a Conda environment named \texttt{trading} with Python version 3.8 and all the required packages.

    \item \textbf{Activate the environment:}

    After the environment is successfully created, it can be activated with the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
